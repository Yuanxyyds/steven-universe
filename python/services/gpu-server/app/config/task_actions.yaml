# Task Actions - Worker Execution Configuration
#
# Maps task_name to worker implementation details.
# Specifies how to build and run the worker container for each task.
#
# Purpose:
#   - Define which Docker image to use
#   - Specify build context and Dockerfile location
#   - Configure runtime command and environment variables
#
# Structure:
#   {task_name}:
#     source_path: Path to worker source code (for building)
#     dockerfile: Path to Dockerfile (relative to source_path)
#     docker_image: Docker image name:tag
#     command: Command to run in container
#     env_vars: Environment variables to set
#     build_args: Docker build arguments (optional)
#
# Note: The service will mount the model path automatically if model_id is specified in task_definitions.yaml
